# Tic-Tac-Toe

I created this game of Tic-Tac-Toe as solution to a solo project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com). Creating this project helped further my learning of Factory Functions, modules, scope, creating public and private functions, and on how to best layout your javascript files and to actually think and plan where functions should be placed.
